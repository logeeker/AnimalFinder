      "description": "Varanasi (Vārāṇasī; [ʋaːˈraːɳəsi]) is a city on the Ganges river in northern India that has a central place in pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu world,[11][12][13] even as the traditions are transformed in the face of modernization, generational changes and emigration.[14][15]  The city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its tourism.[16][17]  The name Varanasi was officially so revived after 1947,[18]  but the city is still widely known by its earlier name Banaras or Benares (Banāras; [bəˈnaːrəs] (listen)),[19][20]  and its ancient name Kashi.[21][22] Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river.  It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of India's capital New Delhi, 320 kilometres (200 mi) south-east of the state capital, Lucknow, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) east of Allahabad, another Hindu pilgrimage site.

Its closest relative is the similar Barrow's goldeneye.[2] The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek boukephalos (\"bullheaded\", from bous, \"bull \" and kephale, \"head\"), a reference to the bulbous head shape of the bufflehead. The species name is derived from the Latin clangere (\"to resound\").[3]"

      "description": "The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), grey mouse lemur or lesser mouse lemur, is a small lemur, a type of strepsirrhine primate, found only on the island of Madagascar. Weighing 58 to 67 grams (2.0 to 2.4 oz), it is the largest of the mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus), a group that includes the smallest primates in the world.  The species is named for its mouse-like size and coloration and is known locally (in Malagasy) as tsidy, koitsiky, titilivaha, pondiky, and vakiandry.  The gray mouse lemur and all other mouse lemurs are considered cryptic species, as they are nearly indistinguishable from each other by appearance.  For this reason, the gray mouse lemur was considered the only mouse lemur species for decades until more recent studies began to distinguish between the species."
